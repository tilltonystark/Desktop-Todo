To convert this Python script into an executable for Windows, you can use tools like PyInstaller. Follow these steps:

Install PyInstaller if you haven't already:
```pip install pyinstaller```

Run PyInstaller to create an executable:
```pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole your_script_name.py```

Replace your_script_name.py with the name of your Python script.

After running this command, PyInstaller will generate an executable file in the dist directory. This executable can then be distributed and run on a Windows system without requiring Python or additional dependencies.
